<H2>About</H2>
Once the processor receives notification of an interrupt, it saves
what it was doing by pushing critical registers and such onto the stack
and then running a specific interrupt handler.  With protected mode
a Interrupt Descriptor Table (IDT) is used to match interupts 0-255
with their handler, each descriptor is 8 bytes in length and
the table can be located anywhere in memory so long as it's
base address is known by using the LIDT instruction to give the
base address.  Under Millennium, the interrupts are located
at the bottom of the memory (0000h:00000000h).

<H2>Types</H2>
There are different types of interrupts, such as ones
caused by external hardware events, there are also <B>software
interrupts</B> which occur by using the INT instruction, and there
are <B>exceptions</B> which are essentially interrupts caused by the
processor itself... and are normally handled by the operating system.
Furthermore, there are three types of exceptions:

<UL>
<LI>Traps: when an exception occurs the address of the next
instruction is pushed onto the stack.</LI>
<LI>Faults: when the address of the instruction that caused the
exception is given so that recovery can be done and the
instruction restarted.</LI>
<LI>Aborts: when an exception is generated by an unknown event.</LI>
</UL> 

<H2>Programmable Interrupt Controller</H2>
The <A HREF="Programmable Interrupt Controller.html">Programmable
Interrupt Controller (PIC)</A> is used to translate hardware interrupts
into interrupts servicable by the processor through the single INTR
line.  The PIC under Millennium is mapped from in the interrupt
table from 32-47, instead of the default, which overlap some
of the processors exception vectors.
