<H2>About</H2>
Millennium is is a 32-bit <A HREF="Protected Mode.html">protected mode</A>
operating system.  Because it runs in the protected mode of the
processor it can directly address upto 4GB, and take full
advantage of the 32-bit processing, hardware level process
protection and a host of other performance enhansing features.
The operating system is simply a number of modules working
together and interfacing with the millennium kernel to
produce the operating system.  These modules can be
compiled directly into the kernel (<B>monolithic</B>) or they
can be compiled into individual modules that would be
loaded into memory only when needed (<B>modular</B>).  Therefore,
the kernel is a hetrogenous kernel.
<P>
Millenium's kernel is responsible for setting the processor into
protected mode.  Which is achieved by constructing the descriptor
tables, enabling the PE bit on the CR0 register, disabling the A20
wraparound line on the KBC (Keyboard Controller), and jumping far
to the 32-bit segment.  You might be asking now what the KBC has to do
with protected mode?  Well, the A20, if enabled, caused any memory
reference beyond the 1MB limit, to loop back over itself, however,
in order to gain full access to the memory under protected mode we must
disable this feature.
<P>
The descriptors setup by the kernel both determine the segmentation of
memory and map the interrupts to their appropriate handler
(known as the ISR - Interrupt Service Routine).  When an interrupt
occurs, the processor stores the currents programs state on the
stack (cs, ip, and flags), it fetches the interrupt vector, transfers
control to the routine pointed to by the vector, and when finished it
returns to the interrupted program.
