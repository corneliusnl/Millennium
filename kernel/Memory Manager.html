<H1>Millennium Memory Manager</H1>
As stated before, Millennium won't be hindered by the infamous 640Kb
limit, but rather will be able to directly address upto 4GB of memory.
The kernel will initialize the GDT (Global Descriptor Table) and will
use a flat model to directly address up to 4GB, upon initialization the
memory will essentially be virgin and processes will fill this global
table with their own Local Descriptor Table (LDT), enabling to further
divide their space into code and data segments.
<P>
The job of a memory manager is to:
<UL>
<LI>Keep track of which parts of memory are in use and which
parts are not in use.</LI>
<LI>To allocate memory to processes when they need it and to
deallocate it when they are done.</LI>
<LI>Furthermore, it is to swap between main memory and disk
when the main memory is too small to hold all processes.</LI>
</UL>

	<H2>Monoprogramming without Swapping or Paging</H2>
	Undoubly the most simple implementation of memory
	management scheme is to allow for the running of
	only one program at a time, sharing memory between
	that program and the operating system.
