<H2>About</H2>
The PIT chip has 3 channels, each of which are responsible for a different
task on the PC:
<P>
Channel 0 is responsible for updating the system clock. It is usually
programmed to generate around 18.2 clock ticks a second. An interrupt 8 is
generated for every clock tick.
<P>
Channel 1 controls DMA memory refreshing. DRAM is cheap, but it's memory
cells must be periodically refreshed or they quickly lose their charge. The
PIT chip is responsible for sending signals to the DMA chip to refresh
memory. Most machines are refreshed at a higher rate than neccesary, and
reprogramming channel 1 to refresh memory at a slower rate can sometime speed
up system performance. I got a 2.5 MHz speed-up when I did it to my 286, but
it didn't seem to work on my 486SUX33.
<P>
Channel 2 is connected to the speaker. It's normally programmed to generate
a square wave so a continuous tone is heard. Reprogramming it for "Interrupt
on Terminal Count" mode is a nifty trick which can be used to play 8-bit
samples from the PC speaker.
<P>
Each channel has a counter which counts down. The PIT input frequency is
1193181 ($1234DD) Hz. Each counter decrements once for every input clock
cycle. "Terminal Count", mentioned several times below, is when the counter
reaches 0.
<P>
Loading the counters with 0 has the same effect as loading them with 10000h,
and is the highest count possible (approx 18.2 Hz).

<H2>The PIT Ports</H2>
The PIT chip is hooked up to the Intel CPU through the following ports:

<PRE>
<B>Port   Description</B>
40h    Channel 0 counter (read/write)
41h    Channel 1 counter (read/write)
42h    Channel 2 counter (read/write)
43h    Control Word (write only)

<H2>The PIT Modes</H2>
The PIT is capable of operating in 6 different modes:

<PRE>
<B>MODE 0 - Interrupt on Terminal Count</B>

When this mode is set the output will be low. Loading the count register
with a value will cause the output to remain low and the counter will start
counting down. When the counter reaches 0 the output will go high and remain
high until the counter is reprogrammed. The counter will continue to count
down after terminal count is reached. Writing a value to the count register
during counting will stop the counter, writing a second byte starts the
new count.

<B>MODE 1 - Programmable One-Shot</B>

The output will go low once the counter has been loaded, and will go high
once terminal count has been reached. Once terminal count has been reached
it can be triggered again.

<B>MODE 2 - Rate Generator</B>

A standard divide-by-N counter. The output will be low for one period of the
input clock then it will remain high for the time in the counter. This cycle
will keep repeating.

<B>MODE 3 - Square Wave Rate Generator</B>

Similar to mode 2, except the ouput will remain high until one half of the
count has been completed and then low for the other half.

<B>MODE 4 - Software Triggered Strobe</B>

After the mode is set the output will be high. Once the count is loaded it
will start counting, and will go low once terminal count is reached.

<B>MODE 5 - Hardware Triggered Strobe</B>

Hardware triggered strobe. Similar to mode 5, but it waits for a hardware
trigger signal before starting to count.

Modes 1 and 5 require the PIT gate pin to go high in order to start
counting. I'm not sure if this has been implemented in the PC.
</PRE>

<H2>Counter Latching</H2>
Setting the Read/Load field in the Control Word to 0 (Counter Latch) causes
the appropriate channel to go into a sort of "lap" mode, the counter keeps
counting down internally but it appears to have stopped if you read it's
values through the channel's counter port. In this way you get a stable count
value when you read the counter. Once you send a counter latch command you
*must* then read the counter.

<H2>Registers</H2>
<PRE>
<B>Port 40h, 8253 Counter 0 Time of Day Clock (normally mode 3)</B>
<B>Port 41h, 8253 Counter 1 RAM Refresh Counter (normally mode 2)</B>
<B>Port 42h, 8253 Counter 2 Cassette and Speaker Functions</B>
<B>Port 43h, 8253 Mode Control Register, data format:</B>
<PRE>
76543210  Mode Control Register
        +---- 0=16 binary counter, 1=4 decade BCD counter
     +--------- counter mode bits
   +------------ read/write/latch format bits
 +--------------- counter select bits (also 8254 read back command)

<B>Bits</B>
 76 Counter Select Bits
 00  select counter 0
 01  select counter 1
 10  select counter 2
 11  read back command (8254 only, illegal on 8253, see below)

<B>Bits</B>
 54  Read/Write/Latch Format Bits
 00  latch present counter value
 01  read/write of MSB only
 10  read/write of LSB only
 11  read/write LSB, followed by write of MSB

<B>Bits</B>
321  Counter Mode Bits
000  mode 0, interrupt on terminal count;  countdown, interrupt,
     then wait for a new mode or count; loading a new count in the
     middle of a count stops the countdown
001  mode 1, programmable one-shot; countdown with optional
     restart; reloading the counter will not affect the countdown
     until after the following trigger
010  mode 2, rate generator; generate one pulse after 'count' CLK
     cycles; output remains high until after the new countdown has
     begun; reloading the count mid-period does not take affect
     until after the period
011  mode 3, square wave rate generator; generate one pulse after
     'count' CLK cycles; output remains high until 1/2 of the next
     countdown; it does this by decrementing by 2 until zero, at
     which time it lowers the output signal, reloads the counter
     and counts down again until interrupting at 0; reloading the
     count mid-period does not take affect until after the period
100  mode 4, software triggered strobe; countdown with output high
     until counter zero;  at zero output goes low for one CLK
     period;  countdown is triggered by loading counter;  reloading
     counter takes effect on next CLK pulse
101  mode 5, hardware triggered strobe; countdown after triggering
     with output high until counter zero; at zero output goes low
     for one CLK period
</PRE>

<B>Read Back Command Format  (8254 only)</B>
<PRE>
76543210 Read Back Command (written to Mode Control Reg)
        +--- must be zero
       +---- select counter 0
      +----- select counter 1
     +------ select counter 2
    +------- 0 = latch status of selected counters
   +-------- 0 = latch count of selected counters
 +----------- 11 = read back command
</PRE>

<B>Read Back Command Status (8254 only, read from counter register)</B>
<PRE>
76543210  Read Back Command Status
        +--- 0=16 binary counter, 1=4 decade BCD counter
     +-------- counter mode bits (see Mode Control Reg above)
   +----------- read/write/latch format (see Mode Control Reg)
  +------------ 1=null count (no count set), 0=count available
 +------------- state of OUT pin (1=high, 0=low)
</PRE>

<PRE>
- the 8253 is used on the PC & XT, while the 8254 is used on the AT+
- all counters are decrementing and fully independent
- the PIT is tied to 3 clock lines all generating 1.19318 MHz.
- the value of 1.19318MHz is derived from (4.77/4 MHz) and has it's
  roots based on NTSC frequencies
- counters are 16 bit quantities which are decremented and then
  tested against zero.	Valid range is (0-65535).  To get a value
  of 65536 clocks you must specify 0 as the default count since
  65536 is a 17 bit value.
- reading by latching the count doesn't disturb the countdown but
  reading the port directly does; except when using the 8254 Read
  Back Command
- counter 0 is the time of day interrupt and is generated
  approximately 18.2 times per sec.  The value 18.2 is derived from
  the frequency 1.10318/65536 (the normal default count).
- counter 1 is normally set to 18 (dec.) and signals the 8237 to do
  a RAM refresh approximately every 15s
- counter 2 is normally used to generate tones from the speaker
  but can be used as a regular counter when used in conjunction
  with the 8255
- newly loaded counters don't take effect until after a an output
  pulse or input CLK cycle depending on the mode
- the 8253 has a max input clock rate of 2.6MHz, the 8254 has max
  input clock rate of 10MHz

<B>Programming considerations:</B>
  1.  load Mode Control Register
  2.  let bus settle (jmp $+2)
  3.  write counter value
  4.  if counter 0 is modified, an INT 8 handler must be written to
      call the original INT 8 handler every 18.2 seconds.  When it
      does call the original INT 8 handler it must NOT send and EOI
      to the ~8259~ for the timer interrupt, since the original INT 8
      handler will send the EOI also.
