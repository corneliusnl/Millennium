<H2>Round Robin Scheduling</H2>
	Each process is assigned a time interval, called its
quantum, which it is allowed to run.  If the process is still
running at the end of the quantum, the CPU is preempted and given
to another process.  However, if the process blocked before its
time ran out, the CPU would have then switched to another process.
