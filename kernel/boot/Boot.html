	<H3>Floppy Disk</H3>
	Upon boot-up the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)
	performs numerous activities such as the Power On Self
	Test (POST), one of these includes attempting to read
	the first sector (512 bytes) of a floppy disk, if inserted.
	If successful, and the sector contains a valid boot sector
	program, meaning that the last two bytes of the sector
	contain the magic number AA55h, the program is loaded
	to address 0000h:7C00h.  Here it will be executed and
	normally load a secondary program which will load the
	operating system into memory and execute it.

	<H3>Hard disk</H3>
	Hard disks are a little more complicated due to the fact
	that they can be partitioned.  Similar to a floppy disk
	boot-up, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) performs
	numerous activities such as the Power On Self Test (POST),
	one of these includes attempting to read the first sector
	(512 bytes) of the master hard disk.  This sector contains
	a boot program as well as a partition table marking the
	active partition.  The boot code will normally go to the
	active partition and first verify if the boot code is
	valid (containing the magic number AA55h as the last
	two bytes of the sector) and if successful load it to
	address 0000h:7C00h. Here it will be executed and
	normally load a secondary program which will load the
	operating system into memory and execute it.
