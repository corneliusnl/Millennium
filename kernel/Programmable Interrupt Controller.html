<H2>About the PIC</H2>
The Programmable Interrupt Controller (PIC) allow
peripherial devices to only bother the central
processor only when there's a need for the
device to be serviced.  This is much more
efficient than the other alternative which is
to constantly poll the device -- which consumes
processor power.
<P>
Because Intel processors only have one interrupt pin
a special chip (8259 PIC) is used to allow several
devices to share it.  It's three main purposes are to:

<UL>
<LI>To inform the processor which device is interrupting.</LI>
<LI>To mask interrupts specified by the programmer.  Masked
interrupts will not be processed by the CPU.</LI>
<LI>To handle several interrupts which occur simultaneously
using a system of priorities.</LI>
</UL>

Starting with the IBM PC/AT machines, two PICs are installed
on the motherboard.  Each PIC is capable of handling 8 interrupt
lines, however, the controllers are cascaded with IRQ2 being used
to connect the master to the slave PIC.
<P>
It is important to note that IRQ represent the names of the signals
passing though the chips and not the vector numbers.  For example,
IRQ0 may use interrupt vector 8.

<H2>Operating Modes</H2>
<H3>Fixed Priority Mode</H3>
This mode is set after controller initialization if another
mode is not defined explicitly.  All interrupt requests of the
given controller have priority levels from 0 to 7, with 0 being
the highest.  After acknowledging the interrupt, the controller
sets the bit of the highest priority interrupt to the ISR register,
clears this bit in the IRR register, and puts it interrupt vector
on the data bus.  The interrupt bit in the ISR remains set until the PIC
receives the EOI command, but can be cleared immediately after the
second interrupt has been acknowledged if the automatic end of
interrupt bit in the ISR register is not reset, all subsequent
requests are not processed.

<H3>End of Interrupt Mode</H3>
You can clear the bit in the ISR register using the command
word OSW2, or automatically in Automatic End Of Interrupt mode.
If interrupt cascading is implemeneted in the system, then for
the slave controller you need to send the EOI command twice -
firstly for the master and then for the slave.  There are two
EOI command types: usual and special.  In fixed priority mode
the interrupt controller can always find out the bit that it
ought to reset because it has the highest priority amongst those
which have been set in the ISR register.  Usually, the issued
command is OSW2=20h, which must be written to port 20h or 0A0h.
<P>
If the controller does not preserve the fixed priority levels, in
some cases it can't establish the acknowledged interrupt level.  At
this point the special EOI command may be used as follows:
OSW2 = 0110 0XXX, where XXX is the number of the ISR bit to be
cleared.
<P>
As for the ISR register bit, which is masked by the mask register
bit, it should not be cleared by the normal EOI command if the
interrupt controller operates in specific masking mode.

<H3>Automatic End Of Interrupt</H3>
If bit 1 in ICW4 is set to 1 the controller operates in this mode
until initialized by the ICW4.  In this mode, the interrupt
controller automatically executes the EOI command at each
interrupt acknowledgment.

<H3>Automatic Priority Rotation Mode</H3>
You can use this mode to operate several devices with the same
priority.  In this mode, the lowest priority is given to the
device being serviced.  The level of the following IRQ is given the
highest and so on.  For example, if the level 3 device was served,
the highest priority 0 will have the level 4 device, priority 1 will
have level 5 device, and so on.  If the given level 3 device requires
the service again, it will wait until all other devices, which now
possess higher priority, are served.
<P>
There are two ways of rotating priority.  Firstly, you can use the EOI
command for interrupt completion with bits 5-7 of the OCW2 word set
to 101.  Secondly, if the interrupt controller operates in automatic
rotation priority mode, for priority rotation you need to set bits 5-7
to 100.  You can switch off the automatic rotation priority by setting
these same bits to 000.

<H3>Special Priority Rotation Mode</H3>
You can rotate all interrupt priorities however you want to if you 
set the lowest priority level number while developing the EOI by OSW2 as
follows: OCW2 = 1110 0XXX, where XXX sets the lowest priority level.

<H3>Masking Interrupts</H3>
Interrupt enabling and disabling is performed by masking with OCW1.  The
masking dosen't influence other functions for a given interrupt level and
other level interrupts.

<H3>The Specific Interrupt Masking Mode</H3>
If the interrupt request is already confirmed, but the EOI command has
not yet reset the ISR bit, then the interrupt controller prohibits interrupts
of current or lower priority, and the system may crash.

<H3>Polling Mode</H3>
If the PIC is operating in this mode, interrupts never occur, so the
program must periodically check the PIC status and support interrupts
if they occur.  For IBM PC systems this mode does not apply.

<H3>Fixed Priority Special Mode</H3>
The fixed priority special mode is implemented in systems with slave
interrupt controllers if they wish to preserve the priority of the
slave controllers.  At this point the master controller works in the
given mode.  This mode is similar to the fixed priority mode except that
when the interrupt request from the given slave controller is served, it
is not masked by the master controller and can cause the processor to be
interrupted.  The slave controller is completely masked if it is in
normal mode.  Also, during the interrupt handler execution, it should
check whether the serving interrupt from the given slave interrupt
controller is unique.  You make the check by issuing the usual EOI
command for the slave controller and afterwards reading its ISR register.

<H3>Controller Cascading Mode</H3>
If the interrupt controller is a master one, it can be attached to 8 slave
controllers.  This gives up to 64 priority levels.  The master and slave
controllers are connected by the bi-directional internal three-line bus.
During the first interrupt request acknowledgement, the master controller
passes the current slave controller number through the bus and then permits	
the slave controller to set its interrupt vector.
<P>
If the interrupt controller operates in cascading mode, then any interrupt
controller can be initialized independantly and operate in its own mode,
which differs from other controller modes.  In this case the EOI commands
are duplicated - one for the master, and one for the slave.  Each controller
has its own two I/O controls ports.

<H2>Processing Interrupts</H2>
Below is a list of the sequence of events that occur when an
interrupt occurs.
<OL>
<LI>A devices connected to a certain IRQ pin sends an interrupt
request.  The corresponding bit in the IRR is set.</LI>
<LI>The I8259 chip processes the request taking into account
the mask and priorities.  It then generates the INT signal for
the CPU</LI>
<LI>When the processor receives this signal it finishes the
current instruction and sends two pulses on the INTA line.  The
first pulse informs the PIC that the processor is ready to accept
an interrupt.  The PIC sets the corresponding bit in the ISR and
clears a bit in the IRR.  The second pulse causes the PIC to output
the vector number to the data bus.</LI>
<LI>The processor pushes the values of the Flags Register, CS and IP
on the stack.</LI>
<LI>The processor clears the TF and IF flags.</LI>
<LI>CS and IP are loaded with the new values from the Interrupt
Vector Table.</LI>
<LI>Control is transferred to the corresponding Interrupt
Service Routine.</LI>
<LI>The IRET instruction at the end of the Interrupt Service
Routine restores old values of CS, IP, and the Flags Register.
The processor then continues execution of the interrupted program.</LI>
</OL>

<H2>Registers</H2>
The PCI accepts seven 8-bit commands.  Named ICW1...ICW4 (Initialization
Control Words) and OCW1...OCW3 (Operation Control Words).  The master
is accessible through ports 20h and 21h and the slave through
A0h and A1h.  The I8259 differentiates among OCW and ICW by the port
addresses, special constant bits for each word, and the sending
sequency (ICW1 must be followed by ICW2, etc).  You can send OCWs to
switch the I8259 into various modes at any point after initialization.

case initialization begins again.
