<H1>Mutual Exclusion Algorithms</H1>
	The process of making sure that if one process is using a
shared variable or file, the other processes will be excluded from
doing the same thing.

<H2>Disabling Interrupts</H2>
	Does mutual exclusion by having each process disable all
interrupts just after entering its critical region and re-enable
them just before leaving it.  With interrupts disabled, no clock
interrupts can occur.  The CPU is only switched from process to
process as a result of clock or other interrupts, therefore, once
a process has disabled the interrupts it can examine and update
the shared memory without fear of interference from another
process.
	While convient for the kernel to have control over the
setting and unsetting of interrupts, it is generally not a good
idea to give this ability to a process in the event that the
process fails to re-enable the interrupts.  Furthermore, on a
multiprocessor system, disabling interrupts only affects the
processor on which the instruction was executed, the other
processor would be free to access the shared memory.

<H2>Lock Variables</H2>
	In this algorithm a variable is used which is initially 0.
When a process wants to enter its critical region, it first tests
the lock.  If the variable is 0, the process sets it to 1 and enters
the critical region.  If the variable was 1 the process waits until
it becomes 0.
	Unfortunately what happens if one process reads the lock and
sees that it is 0.  Before it can set the lock to 1, another process
is schelduled, runs, and sets teh lock to 1.  When the first process
runs again it continues from where it left off, setting the variable
to 1 and entering the critical region with another process.

<H2>Strict Alternation</H2>
	In this algorithm both process are aware of each other and
try to alternate in entering the critical region by looping until a
certain condition is meet.  This is known as busy waiting, and
usually should be avoided as it wastes CPU time.

<H2>Petersons's Solution</H2>

<H2>TSL Instruction</H2>
	This algorithm uses the TSL (Test and Set Lock) instruction,
which reads the contents of a memory word into a register and then
stores a nonzero value at that memory address.  This gurantees that
no other instruction can access the memory word until the instruction
has completed.
	Again the only problem is that the process will waste CPU
time by looping until the desired condition is meet.
