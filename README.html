<H1>Millennium Operating System</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Introduction</H2>
Would you believe me if I were tell you there was a world
outside of Microsoft's Operating System?  A world in which
drives and peripherals were not addressed by lettering, and
where confusing terms such as conventional, expanded, and
extended memories did not exist.  I didn't, because of Microsoft's
abstraction from the lower level hardware.  While this hardware
abstraction may be great for beginning computer users, it effectively
makes us stupid!  It prevents us from further learning and progression
and it is what we intend to eliminate in the development of the
Millennium operating system!

<H2>Intentions</H2>
Millennium intends to make the user a more active participant in the operating
system.  The user would compile his/her own kernel by selecting which
components are important to them, experiment with different algorithms,
and perform open heart surgery on other aspects of the operating system.
So the user is not only presented with a nice polished and easy to use
operating system, but one which they can also can take apart and see how it works.
<P>
But that's not all that this project will accomplish. Because of great
effort I have put into the documentation and the writing of clear and
understandable source code, many enigmatic entities will be explained
and understood, providing the knowledge for other operating system designers
and implementers, or just the curious.
<P>
I want this operating system to succeed, because I believe that by providing
a operating system with complete, well written source code, it will supercede
all current operating systems available, and extend into the future as people
all across the globe add and expand to the operating systems capabilities.
This is no pipe dream, already free operating systems such as Linux are
widely used and developed throughout the world.  Companies are
looking to Linux as an alternative operating system and directly supporting
this operating system.  So why develop Millennium?  The reason is that
while Linux is a great operating system, it is none the less a clone of Unix,
and not intended to be a replacement to Microsoft Windows... while
Millennium tries to bridge the gap by taking the best of both worlds and
incorporting them into one single operating system.

<H2>Considerations</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Source code must be written with standards including a header, well
written and easy to understand code, as well, many comments and good
documentation.  This is done with the purpose of encouraging the expansion
of the Operating System so that it may compete with many commercial Operating
System, such as OS/2 Warp, Unix, Mac OS, and of course, Windows.</LI>

<LI>Many different algorithms will be coded so that any user may try different
combinations in compiling a kernel, and as a result earn greater understanding.
With this understanding, everyone will be able to have a part in the operating
system, allowing them to report bugs or fix them themselves, or possibly,
discovering alternative, more effective methods.</LI>

<LI>I will also be keeping a detailed revisions log with all of the sub-projects
of the Operating  System, to record important revisions and other information.
This is important in debugging and as well for the Science Fair, in which the
judges might be interested in the evolution of the project from infancy to maturity.</LI>

<LI>Furthermore, despite the great appeal of changing the API (Application
Programming Interface) around, where possible
I've made great efforts to keep things the same.  After all, who wants the API
to be totally different when it achieves the same function.  Therefore, when
ever possible I've decided to use the same API naming conventions as used
world wide, many of the BIOS will be mapped as in DOS.  This is done
to encourage programmers from other Operating Systems to port their
applications, without the of hassle of trying to recall what such a
function is named under the Millennium OS.</LI>

<LI>Further standardization is achieved by adhering to international standards
such as POSIX and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).</LI>

<LI>Finally, there is this documentation, which I immediately realized upon
deciding to undertake this project, would be necessary to report my
intentions and describe to the best of my ability what is involved.  Actually,
this documentation started long before I have begun coding, as a method of
gathering all the information together and clearing a number of topics for myself.</LI>
