(Sept 3rd, 1998)
I'm writing untested code with no idea as to whether or not it will work
at the end of the day.  I find myself questioning whether or not I should
further procede with such an ambitious project that I fear will again go
unnoticed by my judges despite the amount of effort that I have put into
such a large project.  I question my sanity for pursing this project, and
it seems that the major force acting upon me is my delusions of grandure...
but still the fear that all my work will go unnoticed slows down my progress
by causing me to doubt and question everything.

(September 15th, 1998)
School has started, which is great because I find I do a lot more with
less time when school starts.  I have been aimless over the past few weeks
and unsure of what I should devote my efforts towards... I don't want to
work upon another project that, despite exhibiting advanced programming,
having no real applicable innovation that wouldn't require a major amount
of development, not only on my part, but on societies.  I have decided that
making my own operating system should not be the goal now, but to implement
my innovative operating system ideas into the Linux project, under my own
distribution.  As it would be foolish of me to think that I could make an
entire operating system along with my innovations into a working project 
in time for the science fair, and I have to realize that the innovation
is the key.  With school having started, the gears are turning, and I've
had some good ideas develop over the past few days that I feel should be
developed as I feel they are the future of computers.  What I have to do
now is watch a lot of Star Trek, do some reasearch into the human brain
(in search for the perfect human computer interface), get some books
on Linux programming, find what tools are available to me, and try
and predict the future of computing by looking to the essentially
characters of man/woman.
