<H2>About</H2>
The filesystem is, as the name suggests, a system for
the storage and retrievel of files on disk.  The filesystem
stores information on the files and directories onto a disk
which can be read from the operating system and translated
into a form more readily viewed by the user.
<P>
There are, however, many different filesystems (algorithms for storing
information on disk).  Each operating system typical has its own
filesystem (Linux has ext2, and Microsoft Windows has vfat).
Millennium, however, does not have it's own proprietary
filesystem but can use any filesystem desired through the
use of <B>Millennium's Filesystem Abstraction Layer (MFSAL)</B> this
layer provides a generic interface for which the kernel can interface
with a filesystem -- thereby creating filesystem independance.

<H2>Algorithms</H2>

<H3>Contiguous Allocation</H3>
This is the simpliest allocation algorithm in which each file
is a contiguous block of data on disk.  Thus on a disk with 1K
blocks, a 50K file would be allocated 50 consecutive blocks.
The maintainence of files is simplified as all that is required
is the location of the beginning block and the number of blocks,
which can then be read in one read operation.
<P>
The disadvantages of this system, however, are fragmentation and
the need for the file's final size to be known before being written.

<H3>Linked List Allocation</H3>
Using this algorithm each block of data has a header which points
to the next block of the file.  Using this method all blocks can
be used, however, randomly accessing blocks of data is
painfully slow.  In addition, while not fatal, because of the header
the data is no longer a power of two -- which is inefficient as
many programs access data as powers of two.

<H3>Linked List Allocation Using and Index</H3>
Both disadvantages of the <I>linked list allocation</I> algorithm
can be eliminated by taking the header of each block and placing
it in a table or index in memory.  Usign this method, therefore,
allow for the complete block to be used and random access can be
speed up by using the table in memory.
<P>
The primary disadvantage of this method is that the table
must reside in memory and with a large a large disk this
table with consume a large amount of memory.  The MS-DOS
filesystem which uses this method avoids using large tables
by using large blocks.

<H3>I-Nodes</H3>
Yet another algorithm for keeping track of blocks is to associate
each file with a table called an i-node (index-node), which lists
the attributes and disk addresses of the file's blocks.
