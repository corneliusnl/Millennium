The floppy disk controller used by floppy disk systems
is the NEC PD765.

<H2>Registers</H2>

<H3>Digital Output Register at 3F2h</H3>
<PRE>
76543210  port 3F2h  (write only)
       +------ floppy drive select (0=A, 1=B, 2=floppy C, ...)
      +------- 1 = FDC enable, 0 = hold FDC at reset
     +-------- 1 = DMA & I/O interface enabled  (reserved PS/2)
    +--------- 1 = turn floppy drive A motor on
   +---------- 1 = turn floppy drive B motor on
  +----------- 1 = turn floppy drive C motor on; (reserved PS/2)
 +------------ 1 = turn floppy drive D motor on; (reserved PS/2)
</PRE>

<H3>Main Status Register at 3F4h</H3>
<PRE>
76543210  port 3F4h  (read only)
        +---- floppy drive 0 in seek mode/busy
       +----- floppy drive 1 in seek mode/busy
      +------ floppy drive 2 in seek mode/busy (reserved PS/2)
     +------- floppy drive 3 in seek mode/busy (reserved PS/2)
    +-------- FDC read or write command in progress
   +--------- FDC is in non-DMA mode
  +---------- I/O direction;  1 = FDC to CPU; 0 = CPU to FDC
 +----------- data reg ready for I/O to/from CPU (request for master)
</PRE>

<H3>Command Status Register 0 at 3F5h</H3>
<PRE>
76543210  Command Status Register 0 at port 3F5h
       +------ unit selected at interrupt (0=A, 1=B, 2=...)
      +------- head number at interrupt (head 0 or 1)
     +-------- not ready on read/write or SS access to head 1
    +--------- equipment check (see note)
   +---------- set to 1 when FDD completes a seek command
 +------------- last command status (see below)

 76  Last Command Status
 00  command terminated successfully
 01  command execution started but terminated abnormally
 10  invalid command issued
 11  command terminated abnormally due to a change in state of
     the Ready Signal from the FDC  (reserved on PS/2)
</PRE>

<H3>Command Status Register 1 at 3F5h</H3>
<PRE>
76543210  Command Status Register 1 at port 3F5h
        +---- FDC cannot find ID address mark (see reg 2)
       +----- write protect detected during write
      +------ FDC cannot find sector ID
     +------- unused (always zero)
    +-------- over-run;  FDC not serviced in reasonable time
   +--------- data error (CRC) in ID field or data field
  +---------- unused (always zero)
 +----------- end of cylinder; sector# greater than sectors/track
</PRE>

<H3>Command Status Register 2 at 3F5h</H3>
<PRE>
76543210  Command Status Register 2 at port 3F5h
        +---- missing address mark in data field
       +----- bad cylinder, ID not found and Cyl Id=FFh
      +------ scan command failed, sector not found in cylinder
     +------- scan command equal condition satisfied
    +-------- wrong cylinder detected
   +--------- CRC error detected in sector data
  +---------- sector with deleted data address mark detected
 +----------- unused (always zero)
</PRE>

<H3>Command Status Register 3 at 3F5h</H3>
<PRE>
76543210  Floppy Disk Drive Status at port 3F5h
       +------ FDD unit selected status (0=A, 1=B, 2=...)
      +------- FDD side head select status (0=head 0, 1=head 1)
     +-------- FDD two sided status signal
    +--------- FDD track zero status signal
   +---------- FDD ready status signal
  +----------- FDD write protect status signal
 +------------ FDD fault status signal
