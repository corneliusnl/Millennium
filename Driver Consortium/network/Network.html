<H2>About</H2>
Each network card has to have it's own driver to modify the
cards features at a register level.  It is hoped that
network card manufactures will in future directly provide support
by developing there own Millennium drivers for their cards.
Until then, however, the responsibility will fall upon on
the Millennium development team and
individual Millennium users.
<P>
The Millennium Operating System provides a generic network card
interface between the kernel and the network driver.  This
interface is known as the <B>Millennium Network Abstraction Layer (MSNL).</B>
