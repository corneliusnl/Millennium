<H3>0388h (W) Register Port</H3>
<PRE>
<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
 Selects register index into left-channel synthesizer data port (0389h)

<B>PROCEDURE</B>
 a) Write register index (0388h)
 b) Wait 3.3s (0.0?s OPL3)
 c) Write register data  (0389h)
 d) Wait 23s  (0.28s OPL3)

<B>NOTES</B>
  Original SoundBlaster Pros were equipped with dual OPL2 synthesizers,
   connecting this channel to the left speaker exclusively; whereas later
   models began using OPL3-compatible synthesizers, which send all output
   to both the left and right speakers unless programmed to do otherwise.
  Alias for FM Music - Left Register Port (02x00h).
