<H2>About</H2>
Each sound card has to have it's own driver to modify the
cards features at a register level.  It is hoped that
video card manufactures will in future directly provide support
by developing there own Millennium drivers for their cards.
Until this is done, however, the responsibility must fall upon
the Millennium development team and individual Millennium users.
<P>
The Millennium Operating System provides a generic sound card
interface between the kernel and the sound driver.  This
interface is known as the <B>Millennium Sound Abstraction
Layer (MSAL)</B>.
