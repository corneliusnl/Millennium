The mouse interface is quite simple, with the mouse
periodically checking its position and button status and
sending a packet to the serial port.  Each byte received
is stored in the serial port receive buffer.  Having
placed the byte in the buffer, the serial port controller
issues an interrupt - IRQ4 for COM1.  If that interrupt
is not masked eithor in the serial port or in the
interrupt controller, it arrives at the processor and the
INT 0Ch (for COM1) occurs.

<H2>Two Button Mice</H2>
For 2 buttom mice this packet consists of three bytes.
