	Millennium supports all standard VGA cards, however, support
	of SVGA cards is limited due to the lack of international
	standards.  As a result of this lack of a standard each
	video card has to have it's own driver to modify the
	cards features at a register level.  It is hoped that
	video card manufactures will in future directly provide support
	by developing there own Millennium drivers for their cards.
	Until this is done, however, high resolution video drivers will
	have to be developed soley by the Millennium development team and
	individual Millennium users.
	<P>
	The Millennium Operating System provides a generic video card
	interface between the kernel and the video driver.  This
	interface is known as the <B>Millennium Video Abstraction 
	Layer (MVAL)</B>.
