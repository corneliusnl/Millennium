Millennium Operating System Assembler

(July 3rd-4th)  I never intended to pursue my operating system idea
any further than what I had been able to get done in the last year
when I had to essentially give up due to difficulties and my personal
inexperience, however, strangely enough I find myself being pulled back
in.  I'm determined not to sleep until I have a functioning version
of my assembler that will at least create a simple boot sector.  In any
event, I imagine that this project will develop into a small operating
system at the least... the assembler is organized in a modular and object
orientated design that will ensure that it's popularity.

(July 5th-6th) Worked on the implementation of the symbol table and
type tables necessary for the development of the assembler.

(July 7th) Discovered bug that caused segmentation faults at the end
of an assembly due to the destruction of the predefined types
in the parser class after they had been destroyed by the type table
class.
