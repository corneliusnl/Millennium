	The Graphic User Interface originated with the Macintosh
	Operating System, with it brought a number of new
	possibilities and a new audience of computer users.
	Today, it is imperative that we have a GUI similar to that
	of the Mac OS or the popular Windows 95.  With this in mind
	I decided to attempt developing a basic windowing system for
	Millennium -- a productivity enhancing user interface for both
	computer gurus and "newbies".
	<P>	
	For a number of years I had faithfully developing
	software for the Microsoft Windows windowing system,
	and when I initially started this project I though I
	would leave the windowing system part for the next year.
	I didn't realize at the time how windows operated, I
	was intimated by what looked like a huge grand scale
	abstraction, however, when I went back and started to
	investigate I discovered that it was not Star Wars
	technology, but rather, it was just the way in which
	Microsoft was presenting the interface.  I believe
	this to be intentional to try and make us "stupid",
	by presenting us with this intimidating interface,
	brainwashing us into believing that this is Star Wars
	technology taking hundreds of men in white coats to
	develop over the course of the last decade and that
	they can be only one!
	<P>
	They failed however, I'll admit that I came very close
	to joining the "dark side of the force."  It is my
	goal to make this operating system become the most
	widely used operating system throughout the world,
	and to ensure this dominance through the distribution
	of complete source code with the operating system.
	Because it is only possible to stay on top by letting
	the people get what they want and not only what I should
	deem important.
