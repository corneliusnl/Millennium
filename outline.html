<H2>Purpose</H2>
To design a revoluntionary operating system which employs several
new technologies developed by Leprechaun Software, to revolutionize
the way in which we interface with computers.  As well as to create
a powerful 32-bit, multitasking, and highly modular and extensible
operating system.

<H2>Procedure</H2>
<OL>
<LI>Did some research on the development of an operating system
by reading some books and surfing the net and finding what
documentation was available.</LI>

<LI>Wrote some sample boot sector code which when wrote to the first
sector of a disk would execute a small 512 byte program that would
preform some simple action using BIOS</LI>

<LI>Did some research into the architecture of Intel and compatibles
and determined that the Millennium Operating System would have to
take full advantage of the Intel processor by using it's advanced
protected mode feature which offers protection, full 32-bit
processing, multitasking, and many other advanced features.</LI>

<LI>After reviewing the great technicial documentation available
from Intel, I decided to expand upon the boot sector to ensure
that the host processor was a 386+ (needed for advanced protected
mode features) and if so read a number of other sectors from
the disk which contained a simple kernel which would look the
processor into protected mode, organize memory and interrupt
handlers, etc.

<LI>I had to yet again stop and do some research as I realized
my next step would be a considerable one.  It was during this
time I decided what features I wanted in an operating system
and at the same time I realized just how difficult it would
be to accomplish this.  I would have to develop a filesystem,
a method of communication, drivers, etc... this was quite an
enormous task and I realized that the project would not be
completed in time for the 1998 Science Fair.  I therefore
decided to start upon a new project while conducting research,
learning more about Linux and operating systems.</LI>

<LI>I would return with a new found enthusiam and determination
in the summer of 1998 to develop the operating system.  With
the knowledge I had gained from my previous project and the
research in between I felt confident that I could accomplish
the impossible and develop this operating system.</LI>

<LI>Deciding that I did not particularly like any of the freely
available assemblers I decided to develop my own using the technical
documentation contained on the CD-ROM's provided by Intel.  However,
I decided that GCC and other GNU tools were of high quality and
decided that I would model my operating system so that these
high quality tools could be ported.</LI>

<LI>I was determined to keep myself busy, however, and while
developing the assembler I was also structuring the operating
system, writing documentation, and writing drivers and
kernel code that would later be seamlessesly connect together --
well, at least after all the errors and bugs were worked out.</LI>
